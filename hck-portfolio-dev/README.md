# HCK_Portfolio_Dev  
**Part of the [HCK_Labs](https://github.com/HuckleR2003/HCK_Labs)** — educational and experimental AI engineering ecosystem.  

Version: **1.0.0 (Alpha Release)**  
Author: **Marcin “HuckleR” Firmuga (HCK)**  
Status: *Active Development*

---

## Overview
**HCK_Portfolio_Dev** is an interactive, educational web project — the visual front of the **HCK_Labs** ecosystem.  
It serves as both a **portfolio hub** and an **AI playground**, presenting ongoing experiments, mini-projects, and tools that combine web, AI, and diagnostics.
> “From micrograd to miniGPT — building and explaining each layer.”

This prototype demonstrates how engineering documentation, design, and live tools can merge into one unified educational platform.
-----
### Core Sections
- **Hero System:** dynamic hero text and smooth background transitions driven by scroll-sentinels.
- **Projects Grid:** interactive filtering (AI, Python, Web, Tools).
- **Featured Carousel:** highlight selected repositories and notebooks.
- **Quick Stats:** animated counters tracking learning progress and project scale.
- **Integrated Tools:**
  - *hck-GPT (alpha)* — simple local chatbot UI.
  - *Diagnostic Console (demo)* — simulated connectivity tests.
  - *HCK_Files manager (alpha)* — educational file explorer with mock file previews.
-----
### Technical Highlights
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS — no build systems, no dependencies.
- Modular structure (clear separation of assets, components, and JS logic).
- Accessibility-ready (semantic markup, ARIA labels).
- Lightweight animations, optimized rendering, and responsive layout.
- Future-ready for integration with backend APIs and MySQL demo environment.
