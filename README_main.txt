| HCK_Labs – Educational AI Engineering Repository |
--------------------------------------
Author: Marcin "HuckleR" Firmuga (HCK)
Created: 2025-10-26
Version: 1.0 (Alpha Stable)
Status: Development / Public Release
--------------------------------------
______
VISION
-----------
HCK_Labs is an open, educational engineering repository focused on learning by building — compact, transparent AI/ML implementations (from autograd to miniGPT).
Each project emphasizes readability, strong documentation, and reproducible experiments for both learning and showcasing engineering quality.
____________________
Why this repo exists
--------------------
-To document a clear and honest progression from fundamentals → applied AI systems.
-To demonstrate engineering literacy: tests, CHANGELOGs, docstrings, clear READMEs.
-To provide open-source, educational examples that teach AI through implementation — not abstraction.
_______________
Core principles
---------------
Code should teach — every file and function explains its purpose.
Incremental commits — every iteration is tracked and transparent.
Reproducibility first — deterministic seeds, small datasets, reproducible runs.
Educational clarity — comments > cleverness.
Public-by-design — clean history, proper license, open documentation.
