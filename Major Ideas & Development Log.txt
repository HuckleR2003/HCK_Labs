HCK_Labs — Major Ideas & Development Log

Date: 27 October 2025
Author: Marcin Firmuga

____________________________________________________________________________________
[25.10] --- Foundation Phase: Birth of HCK_Labs
Milestones:
Established the HCK_Labs environment as a central hub for R&D and AI infrastructure.
_____________________________________________________
Designed the initial project architecture, including:
micrograd_hck_engine-Py — a custom autograd engine inspired by Karpathy’s micrograd, serving as
a foundation for educational neural computation.
AI_Project_1-ChatbotFAQ — the first practical AI use case for HuckHub’s intelligent assistant.

Initiated multi-stage development workflows and documentation standards for all future submodules.

____________________________________________________________________________________
[27.10] — Expansion Phase: Systems, Structure & Intelligence
_________________________________________________________________
1. how_it_works_cross.txt — Universal Project Documentation Layer

Introduced a new file-based documentation system designed to live inside every project folder.
Each how_it_works_cross.txt describes:
What each file does and how it connects to others (HTML ↔ CSS ↔ JS ↔ Python ↔ SQL).

The role of the script within the larger ecosystem.

Next step:
Start building how_it_works_cross_ai_introductions.py,
 an experimental AI-driven analyzer that will interpret and summarize these cross-docs automatically
 — forming the basis for HCK’s future “AI-assisted documentation engine.”
________________________________________________
2. Test Database Environment (MySQL Integration)
Created a foundational database testing layer using:

XAMPP, MariaDB, phpMyAdmin, and PHP for backend integration.

Test schema: test_db → table connections_test.
This setup forms the core diagnostic layer for upcoming features like the Console and Log Monitor.
____________________________________________________________
3. STRUCTURE_TEMPLATES — Educational Architecture Blueprints
Developing a library of ready-to-run project templates combining multiple languages and layers:
HTML + CSS + JS + PY + PHP + SQL + Flask.
Each template will:

Visually test the interconnection between files.
Measure response time (e.g., “HTML → JS: 0.054ms”).
Log results and optionally generate printable diagnostic reports.
The templates will include a built-in console and logging system,
bridging education and engineering through live diagnostics.

4. hck-portfolio-dev — Main Portfolio & Research Showcase
A high-impact, interactive web environment representing the core identity of HCK_Labs.
Planned key components:

Sleek, futuristic interface inspired by NASA visuals.

Integrated File Explorer for navigating projects visually.

Built-in Messenger-style chat window powered by hck-GPT (offline & online modes).

Diagnostic system derived from STRUCTURE_TEMPLATES, with real-time console logging.

This project will evolve into a public-facing portfolio, an interactive resume,
and an educational AI playground in one.
______________________________________
5. HCK_Files — Web-Based File Explorer
An in-browser file visualization system resembling Windows Explorer or Google Drive.
It will:

Display project hierarchies dynamically.

Interpret and visualize how_it_works_cross.txt data.

Show contextual insights: “You’re currently in micrograd_hck_engine-Py/…”
and highlight relationships between core modules (engine.py ↔ nn.py ↔ optim.py).

This module represents HCK_Labs’ innovative step toward intelligent project introspection.
_____________________________________________
6. Diagnostic Console — “HCK Diagnostic Core”
A fully functional system monitoring interface simulating a developer console.

It will allow:
Reconnection attempts between backend & frontend layers.
Logging success/failure times (e.g., “Reconnected to backend.js in 0.045ms – Success”).
Database connection validation.

“PRINT Results” → automatic report generation (reportlab PDF format).
The console acts as both a debugging and teaching instrument.
______________________________________________
7. hck-GPT — Embedded Conversational Assistant
A proprietary assistant integrated within the portfolio site.

Goals:
Act as a guide and explainer for projects and documentation.
Function offline using a structured JSON knowledge base, with optional cloud API support.
Deliver dynamic, contextual answers in a Messenger-like chat interface.
hck-GPT symbolizes the fusion of AI interactivity, education, and technical transparency.

[31.10] — Milestone: Alpha Stabilization & Publication Prep
_________________________________________________________________
- Consolidated repository under consistent structure and naming.
- Prepared documentation for public transparency and future expansion.
- Declared stable Alpha version (v1.0.0) of HCK_Labs.
- Focus next: finalize README and CHANGELOGs per project (Portfolio, Workman).
